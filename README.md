The idea of this project is for users to write the name of something that they are actively watching and waiting for the release of a new part, and the code provides an opportunity to notify them of the release of that very new part.

The project works like this:
- The user is first added to the Database
- The user is provided with a selection of those categories that you can add to your implementation
- The user enters the name of something that interests him
- Adds itself to the list, when a new part is released, the bot will notify the user (Verification takes place once a day)

Dependencies are installed using the command in the terminal:
  1. python -m vnv venv
  2. Log in to the virtual environment
  3. Install pip poetry
  4. Install poetry
